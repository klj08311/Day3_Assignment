        Hi! I'm Krystal. This page is dedicated to things that I am passionate
        about.

        My main passions are education, baking delicious desserts, and
        collecting Hello Kitty memorabilia. I was previously in the education
        field, working with students with special needs. It was extremely
        rewarding. In my spare time, I like to bake anything I can think of,
        especially cakes and cookies. My favorite cake is Red Velvet, and my
        favorite cookie is snickerdoodle. I started a Hello Kitty collection
        several years ago. I have collected quite a few items, but I still have
        a long way to go before I am a real collector.
